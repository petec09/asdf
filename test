Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</strong></li><li><strong>The use of benzodiazepines, including SYMPAZAN, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Before prescribing SYMPAZAN and throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction.</strong></li><li><strong>Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of SYMPAZAN after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening.

If a decision is made to prescribe SYMPAZAN concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when SYMPAZAN is used with opioids.</div><div class="isi-heading2">Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction</div><div class="isi-text1">Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involves the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involves concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death.</div><div class="isi-text1">Use of SYMPAZAN, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of SYMPAZAN along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of Central Nervous System (CNS) depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.</div><div class="isi-heading2">Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions</div><div class="isi-text1">Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages and those who have had longer durations of use.</div><div class="isi-text1">The continued use of benzodiazepines, including SYMPAZAN, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of SYMPAZAN after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate <strong>acute withdrawal reactions</strong>, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures). In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed <strong>protracted withdrawal syndrome</strong> with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months.</div><div class="isi-text1"><strong>Potentiation of Sedation from Concomitant Use with Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants</strong> SYMPAZAN has a CNS depressant effect. Caution patients and/or caregivers against simultaneous use with other CNS depressants or alcohol as the effects of other CNS depressants or alcohol may be potentiated.</div><div class="isi-text1"><strong>Somnolence or Sedation </strong>SYMPAZAN causes dose-related somnolence and sedation, which generally begins within the first month of treatment and may diminish with continued treatment. Monitor patients for somnolence and sedation, particularly with concomitant use of other CNS depressants. Caution patients against engaging in hazardous activities requiring mental alertness, i.e., operating dangerous machinery or motor vehicles, until the effect of SYMPAZAN is known.</div><div class="isi-text1"><strong>Serious Dermatological Reactions</strong> Serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported with clobazam in both children and adults. Discontinue SYMPAZAN at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related.</div><div class="isi-text1"><strong>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)</strong>, also known as multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including clobazam. These events can be fatal or life-threatening, particularly if diagnosis and treatment do not occur as early as possible. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement. Eosinophilia is often present. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. SYMPAZAN should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.</div><div class="isi-text1"><strong>Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</strong> Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including SYMPAZAN, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</div><div class="isi-text1"><strong>Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome</strong> Use of SYMPAZAN late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate. Monitor neonates exposed to SYMPAZAN during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to SYMPAZAN during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these neonates accordingly.</div><div class="isi-heading">ADVERSE REACTIONS</div><div class="isi-text1">Adverse reactions (≥10% and more frequently than placebo) included constipation, somnolence or sedation, pyrexia, lethargy, and drooling.</div><div class="isi-heading">DRUG INTERACTIONS</div><div class="isi-text1" id="isi3"><strong>Opioids:</strong> The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.</div><div class="isi-text1" id="isi3"><strong>CNS Depressants and Alcohol:</strong> Concomitant use of SYMPAZAN with other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may increase the risk of sedation and somnolence. Caution patients and/or caregivers against simultaneous use with other CNS depressants or alcohol, as effects of other CNS depressants or alcohol may be potentiated.</div><div class="isi-text1" id="isi3"><strong>Hormonal Contraceptives: </strong>Hormonal contraceptives that are metabolized by CYP3A4: Effectiveness may be diminished when given with SYMPAZAN. Additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended when using SYMPAZAN.</div><div
